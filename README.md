# Vehicle-Clustering-using-Hierarchical-Clustering
Suppose that an automobile manufacturer has developed prototypes for a new vehicle. Before introducing the new model into its range, the manufacturer wants to determine which existing vehicles on the market are most like the prototypes , i.e. , how vehicles can be grouped, which group is the most similar with the model, and therefore which models they will be competing against.  In this model we have used clustering methods, to find the most distinctive clusters of vehicles. It will summarize the existing vehicles and help manufacturers to make decision about the supply of new models. Here we have used Hierarchical Clustering to find the cluster of the existing vehicles.
